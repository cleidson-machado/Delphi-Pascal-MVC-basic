## My First attempt Project using Delphi-Pascal Code / with Just pure Code only

Hello.. In this small project I use advanced object-oriented programming techniques. But it was just an experimental attempt using Delphi's Pascal (Object Pascal). I hope this study can help someone to using Delphi's ObjectPascal, just as JAVA, PHP or Python are used, that is emphasis on pure code. Remembering that in Delphi it is more common to create or start a project thinking about the visual part of the user interaction and only then think about or adjust the details of the code. Thanks!
